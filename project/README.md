## Project 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

In the README.md file for the root repo, relevant information about the dataset can be found
(where it was created, were it was downloaded from, how many variables, how many observations).
In the same file, are the instructions for the project.

In this folder are the four scripts to produce the figures required.

The script looks for a specific directory in the hard drive.
If the directory is not found, it creates and uses it a the working directory.
The path to the working directory was specified relative to the home directory (~).
This is intedend to help with reproducibility. If necesary, edit the path to the
working directory.
